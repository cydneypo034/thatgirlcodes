# That Girl Codes

That Girl Codes is an application that helps women who want to code network with each other and find new resources to learn coding. It's a hub for women who want to break
into the field of tech and are looking for resources to help them learn to code so they can earn high paying jobs as software engineering, data science and ux designers. 

You can add yourself to our growing community of women and add your favorite resource that you’d like to use to learn coding whether that’s a website or book.

## Future Plans

- Add feature where users can add their photo in the Add User and Edit User Components
